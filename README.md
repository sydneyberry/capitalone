## Technologies Used
* Chart.js

## Personal Reflection
I did not start this site until a week ago. Why? Because I didn't think I could do it. Looking at the data, I was extremely intimidated by the sheer amount of data and I had no idea how or where to start. 

Did you make it this far? Thanks. It means a lot. My path to computing isn't straightforward, but it has played a major role in my interests and pursuits. Overall...
## Thank you for this challenge!
