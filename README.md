## Challenge Response -- Psyched to Cycle!
This site is meant to provide different visuals and representations of a bike share dataset in Los Angles for July 2016-March 2017. It was developed with different languages and frameworks, as detailed below.

## Technologies Used
* Chart.js
* Materalize/Bootstrap
* Visual Basic in Excel
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## What I learned
I'll admit that after going through all the data and reading the requirements, I didn't intend to do the challenge. It was overwhelming and I had never done anything even close to this site; I had no idea where to even start on working with 130,000+ rows of data. However, about a week ago, I decided that I needed to expand the type of projects I worked on and decided to start with learning Visual Basic after hearing someone say that you can use it in Excel.

After countless different articles, I was able to start analyzing the data and recorded the results. These results were then put into Chart.js sections, which was another huge accomplishment for me because I always struggled with even implementing outside libraries. All this code can be found in the repository for this project.

This challenge was an amazing experience to really push myself and see how much I can accomplish in as short as a week. I overcame that fear of working with data and feel a lot more comfortable in working between different languages for one project. Up until this point, I don't think I've had a class really push me like this or work with anything but C/C++ or assembly.
## Thank you for this challenge!
