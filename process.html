            <h5 align="center">Developing this site</h5>
            <p>This site was developed with a mix of differnt languages and then hosted using GitHub pages. For the layout of the site, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Materialize</b> were used to help set up the CSS/grid system HTML. Additionally, I coded a lot with <b>HTML/CSS</b> in general for helping bring this site to life. <b>Particle.js</b> was used for the moving background pattern at the top of each page while <b>Chart.js</b> was used for creating the visuals/graphs shown. As for the actual data, <b>Visual Basic in Excel</b> was used to work with what was in the Excel worksheet without having to edit it at all or remove any entries.</p>
            <p><i>NOTE: This site was built on a 13" Dell XPS laptop and is not completely responsive. As a result, components may appear different on certain screen sizes</i></p>
            <h5 align="center">What I learned</h5>
            <p>I'll admit that after going through all the data and reading the requirements, I didn't intend to do the challenge. It was overwhelming and I had never done anything even close to this site; I had no idea where to even start on working with 130,000+ rows of data. However, about a week ago, I decided that I needed to expand the type of projects I worked on and decided to start with learning Visual Basic after hearing someone say that you can use it in Excel.</p><p>After countless different articles, I was able to start analyzing the data and recorded the results. These results were then put into Chart.js sections, which was another huge accomplishment for me because I always struggled with even implementing outside libraries. All this code can be found in the repository for this project and </p>
            <p>This challenge was an amazing experience to really push myself and see how much I can accomplish in as short as a week. I overcame that fear of working with data and feel a lot more comfortable in working between different languages for one project. Up until this point, I don't think I've had a class really push me like this or work with anything but C/C++ or assembly.</p>
